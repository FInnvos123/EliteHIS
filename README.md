# EliteHIS
Elite Heading Information System

Also known as Help I'm Stuck

This is an EDMC plugin that lets you set target coordinates and will show you the heading you need to fly to reach your target.
If you set the radius of the planet in the settings menu it will also show the estimated distance to the target. 

NOTE: The distance is only an estimate to give you an idea when to start your descent, it's not completely accurate.

## Installation
- Install [EDMCOverlay](https://github.com/inorton/edmcoverlay/releases)
- Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/FInnvos123/EliteHIS/releases)
- Press the "Open" button on the plugins settings tab in EDMC
- Open EliteHIS.zip and move the directory contained inside into the plugins directory

## Usage
To use EliteHIS simply open the settings menu in EDMC and click the EliteHIS tab.
There you can enter the target latitude and longitude.
To get the estimated target distance you need to enter the planet radius as well.
This can be found in the system map.
Keep in mind that Elite displays the radius in km and EliteHIS expects the radius in m.

## Uninstall
To uninstall the plugin simply remove the EliteHIS directory from the EDMC plugins directory.
If you only want to temporarily disable the plugin, simply rename the folder to `EliteHIS.disabled`
